**Trust, but verify**

GitGud is an open-source DevOps compliance and best practices enforcement platform designed to streamline, automate, and scale DevOps adoption across your organization.

---

## 🌟 Introduction

GitGud transforms fragmented DevOps practices into unified, automated, and transparent workflows. It ensures your teams consistently follow best practices, enhancing real-time compliance, visibility, and collaboration across your entire development organization.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Traditional DevOps approaches often face:

- **Siloed DevOps Practices:** Best practices are fragmented and inconsistently documented.
- **Lack of Visibility & Coverage:** Difficulty tracking adherence to standards across teams.
- **Slow & Manual Scaling:** Inefficient onboarding of teams to standardized practices.

GitGud addresses these challenges by offering real-time, automated, and scalable compliance enforcement directly integrated with your Git workflows.

---

## 📚 Features

### 🌀 Git-Driven Workflows

GitGud seamlessly integrates with GitLab webhooks to trigger policy execution based on Git operations, ensuring continuous adherence to best practices.

### 📊 Real-Time Visualization & Analytics

Track policy execution results and compliance status across all projects in real-time. Get immediate visibility and actionable insights into your organization's DevOps health.

### 📜 Policy as Code

Define policies as structured, version-controlled JavaScript handler scripts. Policies include:

- **Metadata:** Clearly documented goals and categorization.
- **Criteria:** Context-aware execution based on events, branch types, project lifecycles, file paths, repository types, programming languages, and more.
- **Compliance Mapping:** Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically suggest relevant tags and align with industry standards such as ISO and SOC2.

### 🚧 Extensible & Customizable

Policy scripts receive rich contextual data, including information from:

- GitLab events
- Project details
- Integrated services and utilities

This ensures maximum adaptability and customization for your organization's unique needs.

## 🔥 Quickstart Guide

### Requirements

- A local k8s cluster using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (enable via Settings -> Kubernetes in versions > 28.x.x), [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io), or [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/).
- [Tilt](https://tilt.dev) for setting a dev environment on a local k8s cluster.
- [ngrok](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=ngrok&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) for ssh tunneling to allow TLS communication to GitLab.
  1. Go to the Ngrok website and download the version suitable for your operating system.
  2. Follow the instructions on creating a free new static domain.
  3. Update your .env file in the project's root with your GITGUD_NGROK_DOMAIN.
  4. Install an ingress controller on your local k8s cluster using: `helm upgrade --install --namespace kube-system nginx ingress-nginx --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx`

### Installation

```bash
# for ssh
git clone git@github.com:zvikfir/gitgud.git

# for https
git clone https://github.com/zvikfir/gitgud.git

cd gitgud

# npm install packages
(cd backend && npm i)
(cd frontend && npm i)

# configure env vars
cp .env.example .env

# manually set values appropriately


# run the system using tilt. By default, all services are deployed in k8s. Frontend and backend are run locally for faster SDLC.
tilt up

# after postgres is up and running run migrations from another terminal:
npm run migration:migrate
npm run migration:seed

```
